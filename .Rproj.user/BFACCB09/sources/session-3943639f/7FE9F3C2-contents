### **Course Objectives** 

This course provides an introduction to **R**, a free and open-source statistical computing environment and programming language widely used in **data analysis, statistical research, and industrial applications**. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the ability to use **R for problem-solving and practical applications** in social data science. Students will gain hands-on experience with data manipulation, visualization, statistical computation, and analysis beyond basic spreadsheet tools such as Excel.

R is a versatile programming language that enables efficient **data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization**. It runs on multiple platforms, including **UNIX, Linux, Windows, and macOS**.

This course is designed for students who want to learn the fundamentals of R and its applications in social data science. The content focuses on:

-   The **basics of the R environment** and how to navigate it effectively.

-   **Arithmetic and logical operators**, data structures, variables, and data types in R.

-   **Data manipulation and transformation** techniques, including working with R packages for visualization, reporting, and statistical analysis.

-   **Importing, processing, and transforming datasets** for analytical purposes.

-   Core **data science concepts**, including **parametric and non-parametric statistical tests**.

By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in **R programming** and its **applications in data science**, enabling them to analyze and visualize real-world datasets effectively.

### **Course Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

-   **Use R and RStudio effectively** for data analysis and programming.

-   **Process and analyze data** using Râ€™s built-in functions and libraries.

-   **Create visualizations and reports** to communicate data-driven insights.

-   **Apply statistical methods** for data exploration and hypothesis testing.

These skills will provide students with a strong foundation in **data analysis and statistical computing**, preparing them for **more advanced data science and problem-solving tasks**.
